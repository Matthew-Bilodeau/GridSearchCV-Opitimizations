# GridSearchCV-Opitimizations
This repository contains several examples of using GridSearchCV to optimize different machine learning models to predict 2D and 3D plots using SKlearn's GridsearchCv and models as well as Tensorflow and Keras ANN. 

Models used are: 
Linear Regression, DecisionTrees, RandomForests, Gradient Boosting, and ANN. 

These files also display 2D/3D graphing in Matplotlib.
